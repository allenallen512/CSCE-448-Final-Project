# CSCE-448-Final-Project

Tarun Arumugam, Allen Li, James Stautler

This project proposes to implement object removal from images. This involves not only removal of the object but also the filling of the hole created such that the new image is visually plausible. Such implementation will involve a combination of texture synthesis algorithms as well as inpainting techniques. We attempt to recreate the results of the paper “Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting”.

Written for CSCE 448 Spring 2024.
