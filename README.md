# CSCE-448-Final-Project

This project proposes to implement object removal from images. This involves not only removal of the object but also the filling of the hole created such that the new image is visually plausible. Such implementation will involve a combination of texture synthesis algorithms as well as inpainting techniques. We attempt to recreate the results of the paper “Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting”. An example of the desired result from the paper is shown below:
